Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand and process human languages.
Applications of NLP include sentiment analysis, chatbots, language translation, summarization, and information extraction.
In recent years, transformer models like BERT and GPT have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in many NLP tasks.
Summarization systems help condense long texts into key points, which can be used in education, journalism, and customer service.
